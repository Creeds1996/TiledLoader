# TiledLoader
Loads in and renders .tmx files that were created using [Tiled](https://www.mapeditor.org/). (Requires MonoGame).
It can adapt to almost any format that Tiled exports to (.xml, .csv), hopefully I get around to updating it to support all formats sometime soon.

## Purpose
I programmed the following when creating an RPG that I am no longer developing. After I ceased development, I felt it would be a waste to just leave it and instead choose to upload it to Github for public viewing. I uploaded it as a showcase of my programming but also as a tool that people can implement into their own games.
